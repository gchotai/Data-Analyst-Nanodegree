## by Gunja Chotai

# Overview
> Here I selected City Bike System Data: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data as data source for exploration data. Data source includes information about a user type, gender, trip duration and person age who are interested to go on bike trip in the Newyork.
Collect all given .csv files for year 2019 and combine all data together as one dataset for analysis purpose. 

> This project has main two parts. 
> - In the first section, I am preparing an exploratory data analysis on selected dataset. In this I will use Python's numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn library for data visualization and explore the dataset relationships. In the analysis part we should do univariate, bivariate and multivariate relationships exploration.
> - In the second part, I am preparing my findings from relationship exploration and try to convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. 
For this, I will prepare a slide deck that will help me to create proper convenable visualizations to others.
